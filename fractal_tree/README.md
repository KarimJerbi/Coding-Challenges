# #014 Fractal Tree

this is the 14th challenge in coding train's coding challenges.

## Controls

arrows: up and down to modify drawing angle value

## Nice things to add: 

- change color based on branch level ?
- maybe make it dance ?
- an option to increase the number of branches per branch:
a simple for loop(easy)
